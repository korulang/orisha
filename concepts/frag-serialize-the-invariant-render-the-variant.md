# Serialize the invariant once; render the variant live (belief)

A response body that is mostly dataset-constant should not be re-serialized
through a generic writer per request. `writeJsonItem` formatted ten
arguments through `Io.Writer` per item — type-erased calls, alignment logic,
format-string interpretation — for bytes that never change. Measured: ~27%
of all samples under json-tls load, larger than kernel AES-GCM (2.9%) by an
order of magnitude.

The correct split is the request-dependence boundary, not the field boundary:
everything before `"total":` is a per-item constant (prefix slice built once
in `ensureCache`), and the only live render is `price*quantity*m` plus the
closing brace. This stays inside HttpArena's rules — the `?m=N` parameter
exists to defeat whole-response caching, and the response still varies with
both `count` and `m`; it is the same class of pre-serialization `CachedItem`
already used for `name_json`/`tags_json`.

## What the instrument said

json-tls best-of-3: ~34-36.6K before → 37.9-41.4K after; post-change perf
shows the writer symbols below the 1.5% floor entirely. The verification
that could have falsified it — a byte-exact diff of the serialized body
against the previous binary — passed on both cleartext and TLS.

## What the instrument said — second pass (2026-10-08)

The residual `memcpy` was not one copy but two: `body_work` → `http_out`
(`finishHttp` re-printing the finished body) → `send_buf` (`appendPending`).
Since `Content-Length` is computable before writing — the body is prefix
lengths plus decimal widths — the head can land at offset 0 and the body
directly behind it: one contiguous wire message, rendered once. The
`body_work → http_out` pass is gone; `appendPending`'s copy into `send_buf`
is the only one left and it exists for pin safety while a send SQE is in
flight. `send_buf` growth is now doubling-with-floor instead of exact-size,
so a conn's buffer stops reallocating on every larger response (the
`clear_page_erms` term).

Local verification on LinuxKit (no kTLS — the mem-BIO leg): 30/30
`(count, m)` responses byte-identical to the previous binary, 60/60
semantically checked against the dataset (live `total` per `m`), gzip path
unchanged, cleartext + TLS pipelined/keep-alive/close all correct. A wrk
A/B through docker-proxy showed no resolvable delta — laptop timing cannot
falsify this change; the droplet run is the instrument.

## Open questions

- `appendPending` still copies every response once. Removing it means the
  app rendering into `send_buf` (or a per-conn slab) directly — a contract
  change between httparena.kz and the ring, unmeasured.
- Multishot recv / registered buffer rings still untested — the per-CQE
  re-arm tail is the next suspect on baseline/pipelined.
- The heap `Stringify` fallback for overflow counts is unchanged and
  unmeasured for speed — it only needs to be correct.
